MultiDimensional Gene Set Analysis
==================================


About
-----

The `mdgsa` library implements the _gene set analysis_ methodology developed in
[Montaner and Dopazo 2010][montaner2010].
It presents a flexible framework for analyzing the enrichment of _gene sets_ along a given _ranking_ of genes.
The novelty is that,
not just one _ranking index_ but two,
may be analyzed and jointly explored 
in a __multidimensional gene set analysis__.
